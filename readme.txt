Simple, easy, fast and flexible, CIO Bulk Importer processes large data sets from any XML or CSV files to enable efficient update of websites and databases.

== Description ==

Are you planning a new website with many records to update, or have you got a good looking website but spent too much time keeping the content accurate and updated? CIO Bulk Importer is part of the efficient solution to improve work flow and make website updating simple and easy.

CIO Bulk Importer is an add-on linking the following two powerful tools together in delivering an efficient and affordable solution for small and medium businesses.

1. [PODS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pods/). PODS is a free, simple, flexible and powerful CMS framework designed for high performance with large data sets. You can use PODS to extend content types with custom fields, or create custom content types of your own. PODS unleashes the power of Wordpress in creating highly customised CMS. 

2. [WP All Import](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-all-import/). WP All Import is a well developed tool to handle imports from larger XML and CSV files. The free version comes with logging, detection of duplicate records, and templates for future imports and updates.  

Together with Pods and WP All Import, CIO Bulk Importer provides a simple and easy way to build a high performance website, import large data sets and manage ongoing updates from external data sources.  

Accurate and timely website information is crucial to some professions, such as property developers and real estate agents. Mistakes are costly. With CIO Bulk Importer, the principal or person in charge can review information before uploading to the website reducing chances of errors. 


How Does It Work


CIO Bulk Importer automatically detects all your custom fields created with PODS and display them in step 3 of WP All Import. 

The left side shows all of the custom fields that you can import to and the right side displays the data from your XML/CSV file. Then you can simply drag & drop the data from your XML or CSV into the PODS custom fields to import them. 

The CSV or XML can be in any order under any column header, and big files are broken into small chunks to allow importing to shared hosting sites, thanks to the great work by the WP ALL Import team. 

CIO Bulk Importer is a handy tool for people migrating big volume of data from other sources to PODS websites, or regularly importing and updating data on PODS websites, such as real estate property listing websites, or book keeping websites. Simply create custom content types and fields using PODS for fast development and performance, export data to CSV or XML from your data sources or receive from suppliers/clients/partners, and import into PODS custom fields with ease. 


CIO Bulk Importer was used on a shared hosting website created with PODS to import 25,000 records in one go successfully.  

CIO Bulk Importer needs both WP All Import and PODS plugins installed and activated in order to work. Both WP All Import and PODS are freely available in the plugin repository.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I installed and activated this plugin, but canâ€™t find out any menu =

The add-on needs WP All Import and Pods to work. First verify these two plugins are installed and activated. Create a new import under the menu of All Import, upload a test cvs or xml file, then in step 3, you will see custom fields created with Pods. 

= I can import some pods, but have issues importing others. the process is killed by the server =

Possible causes - please check pods fields settings. Mandatory pods fields must be assigned a value for the import to succeed.

= I can't import into some custom fields created with pods =

Possible causes 1 - custom field names shared among pods.

The CIO Bulk Importer detects and lists ALL your custom fields created with PODS in one form in step 3 of the import process, even though you are importing ONE pods content type at a time. The custom fields are grouped by pods labels.

If a field name is used in multiple pods, multiple input cells will be generated in the form with the same field name, and only the value of the last input cells (possibly blank by default) will be saved. 

To avoid this problem, please try to use unique field name when creating your pods. If you have to use the same field name in multiple pods, then you can drag and drop the value to the last input cell.

Possible causes 2 - custom defined list in relationship field

Please check the custom defined list in your relationship field. The value supplied in the csv or xml file has to be in the custom defined list to be imported.

= I can see a pods content type but can't import data to the pod =

CIO Bulk Importer free edition detects and lists all your pods content types however it supports importing and updating of post types only, including new custom post types created with pods, and posts/pages extended with pods. 

Please consider upgrading to [CIO Bulk Importer Pro](http://www.vipp.com.au) to import other content types (including Advanced Custom Types and extended Users). 

= My csv file has many rows, but only the header row is detected  =

This is probably caused by improperly formatted csv files, such as the CSV files saved by Microsoft Excel. You may try to open the csv files using another spreadsheet program such as the free OpenOffice or LibreOffice, save as a new CSV file and see whether the problem is resolved.
